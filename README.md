# Java Programming Challenges

This repo demonstrates how to solve programming problems using Java.

## Primes

For now, this repo will likely only solve the finding Primes problem. Perhaps in the future we may implement more programming solutions. 

## Run the tests

1. From the commandline:

```
mvn clean verify
```

2. In Eclipse, make sure to use the TestNG plugin.
